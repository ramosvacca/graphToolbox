It is a very economically important pathogen in terms of postharvest losses, and a common cause of decay in stored fruits and vegetables. Decay caused by E. carotovora is often simply referred to as \bacterial soft rot\ (BSR) though this may also be caused by other bacteria. Most plants or plant parts can resist invasion by the bacteria, unless some type of wound is present. High humidity and temperatures around 30°C favor development of decay. Mutants can be produced which are less virulent. Virulence factors include: pectinases, cellulases, (which degrade plant cell walls), and also proteases, lipases, xylanases and nucleases (along with the normal virulence factors for pathogens – Fe acquisition, LPS integrity, multiple global regulatory systems).

In some cultivars HCRSV induces chlorotic spots in leaves, but in most it induces leaf mottling and/or chlorotic rings. Some cultivars develop no conspicuous symptoms, especially at high average ambient temperatures such as those in summer in Florida (Raju, 1985). Flowers remain symptomless.\nLeaves of infected Abelmoschus manihot plants are usually chlorotic, and the chlorosis is more conspicuous when HCRSV occurs in complex with other viruses (AA Brunt and RS Phillips, Horticulture Research International, Wellesbourne, UK, personal communication, 1993).\ []",,,,,,,,,,,EFO:0000782,,,,,,,,Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus infection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[""Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus infection""]",,,,,-45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
